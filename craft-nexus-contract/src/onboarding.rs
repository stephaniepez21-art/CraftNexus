//! Onboarding Contract
//!
//! Handles user registration (onboarding), role assignments, username configuration,
//! profile management, and verification processes for buyers and artisans on the CraftNexus platform.
//!
//! # Integration guide
//!
//! This section documents the integration surface that off-chain indexers and
//! client interfaces depend on (Issue #453 / component #52). Three integration
//! channels exist: the **read API** (view functions), the **event stream**, and
//! the **cross-contract interface** shared with the escrow contract.
//!
//! ## Read API for indexers and clients
//!
//! All read functions are side-effect free with respect to *state shape* but
//! refresh the persistent TTL of the entries they touch (via the internal
//! `extend_persistent` helper). Repeatedly reading a profile is
//! therefore safe and additionally keeps the entry from being archived.
//!
//! | Function | Returns | Notes |
//! |----------|---------|-------|
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_user`] | [`UserProfile`] | Panics with [`Error::UserNotFound`] when absent. |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_user_by_username`] | [`UserProfile`] | Looks up by the *normalized* username (lowercased, see `onboard_user`). |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::is_onboarded`] | `bool` | Non-panicking existence check. |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::is_username_taken`] | `bool` | Accepts any casing; normalizes internally. |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_user_role`] | [`UserRole`] | Returns [`UserRole::None`] for unknown users. |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::is_verified`] | `bool` | Reflects manual or auto verification. |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_user_metrics`] | [`UserMetrics`] | Escrow count / volume used for auto-verification. |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_user_reputation`] | `(u32, u32)` | Lifetime `(successful_trades, disputed_trades)` counters. |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_trust_score`] | `u32` | Decaying trust score (#939); lazy-applies decay on read. |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_reputation_history`] | `Vec<ReputationHistoryEntry>` | Recent score-change log for abuse detection (#939). |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_reputation_policy`] | [`ReputationPolicy`] | Decay / cooldown / anti-farming policy (#939). |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_min_reputation_settlement`] | `i128` | Minimum 7-decimal normalized settlement eligible for trust. |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_verification_history`] | `Vec<VerificationEntry>` | Compact entries decoded to human-readable actions. |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_verification_queue`] | `Vec<Address>` | Pending manual-verification requests in FIFO order. |
//! | [`OnboardingContract::get_config`] | [`OnboardingConfig`] | Global contract configuration. |
//!
//! ## Event stream
//!
//! Events are the canonical integration signal for indexers; subscribe to these
//! topics rather than polling. Consumers should treat an event as authoritative
//! only after it appears in a closed ledger. Each row lists the topic tuple, the
//! data payload, and the function that emits it.
//!
//! | Topic tuple | Data payload | Emitted by |
//! |-------------|--------------|------------|
//! | `("UserOnboarded",)` | [`UserOnboardedEvent`] `{ user, username, role }` | [`OnboardingContract::onboard_user`] |
//! | `("RoleUpdated",)` | `(user: Address, old_role: UserRole, new_role: UserRole)` | [`OnboardingContract::update_user_role`] |
//! | `("UserVerified",)` | `user: Address` | `verify_user`, `auto_verify_user`, `process_verification_request` |
//! | `("ProfileDeactivated", user: Address)` | `(user: Address, role: UserRole)` | [`OnboardingContract::deactivate_profile`] |
//! | `("ProfileReactivated", user: Address)` | `(user: Address, role: UserRole)` | [`OnboardingContract::reactivate_profile`] |
//! | `("UsernameChanged",)` | `user: Address` | [`OnboardingContract::change_username`] |
//! | `("PortfolioUpdated",)` | `user: Address` | [`OnboardingContract::update_portfolio`] |
//!
//! Notes for consumers:
//! - `ProfileDeactivated` / `ProfileReactivated` carry the user **in the topic
//!   tuple** so indexers can filter the stream per user without decoding the
//!   payload; the payload additionally carries the role captured at the time of
//!   the transition so no follow-up profile read is required.
//! - `UserVerified`, `UsernameChanged`, and `PortfolioUpdated` carry only the
//!   address; fetch the current value via [`OnboardingContract::get_user`] when
//!   the new field value is needed.
//! - `UserOnboarded` is emitted exactly once per address. An identical
//!   `onboard_user` retry returns the canonical profile and repairs missing
//!   secondary state without emitting another event. A retry with a different
//!   username or role panics with [`Error::AlreadyOnboarded`] (#929).
//!
//! ## Cross-contract interface
//!
//! Onboarding both calls and is called by the escrow contract:
//! - **Outbound:** during [`OnboardingContract::deactivate_profile`] the contract
//!   invokes [`EscrowInterface::has_active_escrows`] (via the generated
//!   `EscrowClient`) to block deactivation while escrows are open.
//! - **Inbound:** the escrow contract — the address stored in
//!   [`OnboardingConfig::escrow_contract`] — is the only authorized caller of
//!   [`OnboardingContract::update_reputation`],
//!   [`OnboardingContract::update_reputation_for_settlement`],
//!   [`OnboardingContract::update_user_metrics`], and
//!   [`OnboardingContract::update_active_contracts`]. When `escrow_contract` is
//!   `None`, the `platform_admin` is used as the authorized fallback.
//!
//! ## Profile versioning
//!
//! Stored profiles are versioned by [`CURRENT_USER_PROFILE_VERSION`]. Older
//! entries (including the legacy version-less shape) are migrated transparently
//! on first read (internal `try_get_user_profile`); integrators never observe an
//! out-of-date shape through the read API.

///
/// ## TTL management
/// [`OnboardingContract::get_user_metrics`] extends the TTL of this entry
/// on every read (via `extend_persistent`) so the record stays live as long
/// as the user's escrow activity is ongoing. Writers (`update_user_metrics`)
/// also extend TTL immediately after the write. The combined read + write
/// refresh ensures the entry survives even during long periods with no new
/// escrow settlements.
///
/// ## Preconditions for writers
/// - Caller must be the [`OnboardingConfig::escrow_contract`] address, or
///   `platform_admin` when no escrow contract is configured.
/// - `volume_delta` must be normalised to 7-decimal stroops before
///   accumulation; raw token amounts in non-standard decimals will produce
///   incorrect threshold comparisons.
///
/// ## Storage side-effects
/// - `DataKey::UserMetrics(address)` — read, incremented, written, TTL extended.
/// - `DataKey::Config` — read to check auto-verify thresholds.
/// - May transitively write `DataKey::UserProfile(address)` and append
///   compact verification history entries when auto-verification triggers.

///
/// # Integration notes — issue #425 / component #24
///
/// ## Purpose
/// Each `VerificationEntry` is a record of a discrete verification lifecycle
/// event for a user: a request, an approval, a rejection, an automatic
/// threshold-based verification, or a revocation triggered by a username
/// change. Together these entries form the user's complete verification audit
/// trail, enabling off-chain indexers and admin dashboards to reconstruct the
/// full history.
///
/// ## Preconditions
/// - Entries are appended only by functions in [`OnboardingContract`] that
///   mutate verification state (`request_verification`, `approve_verification`,
///   `reject_verification`, `auto_verify_user`, `change_username`).
/// - No external contract or account may write entries directly.
///
/// ## Storage side-effects
/// Entries are stored under two key patterns:
/// - `DataKey::VerifyHistoryCount(Address)` — count of entries (u32)
/// - `DataKey::VerifyHistoryIndexed(Address, u32)` — per-entry compact
///   record ([`CompactVerificationEntry`]); the `action` field is stored as
///   [`VerificationActionCode`] to minimise on-chain size.
///
/// Both keys have their TTL extended on every write and on reads that touch
/// the history. The legacy `DataKey::VerificationHistory(Address)` Vec-based
/// key is migrated lazily on first read and should not be written by new code.
///
/// ## Emitted events
/// The functions that append history entries also emit named events on the
/// contract's event stream. Indexers should prefer events over polling:
/// - `request_verification` → `VerificationRequested`
/// - `approve_verification` → `UserVerified`
/// - `reject_verification`  → `VerificationRejected`
/// - `auto_verify_user`     → `UserVerified`
/// - `change_username`      → `UsernameChanged` (if verification is revoked)
///
/// ## Off-chain consumers
/// The `action` field is a human-readable [`Symbol`] — one of:
/// `"requested"`, `"approved"`, `"rejected"`, `"auto_verified"`,
/// `"username_changed_revoked"`.
/// Indexers may store this verbatim; no further decoding is required.

/// each [`CompactVerificationEntry`] ledger entry, lowering rent costs at
/// scale when users accumulate many history records.
///
/// ## Preconditions
/// - Only values defined in this enum are written to storage. Any unknown
///   discriminant encountered during a future upgrade indicates a schema
///   mismatch and should be treated as an error by migration tooling.
///
/// ## Storage side-effects
/// - Stored as the `action` field inside
///   [`DataKey::VerifyHistoryIndexed`]`(Address, u32)` entries.
/// - Discriminant values are **stable** — adding new variants is safe;

/// ## Preconditions
/// - Only the `platform_admin` address may call functions that mutate this
///   config (e.g. `set_config`, `set_auto_verify_config`,
///   `set_escrow_contract`). Each mutating function calls
///   `platform_admin.require_auth()` before any storage write.
/// - `min_username_length` must be ≤ `max_username_length`.
/// - `min_escrow_count_for_verify` and `min_volume_for_verify` are advisory
///   thresholds; setting both to `0` effectively disables the count/volume
///   gates while `auto_verify_enabled` remains the master switch.
///
/// ## Storage side-effects
/// - Stored persistently under `DataKey::Config` (singleton).
/// - TTL is extended on every read and write via `extend_persistent`.
/// - Any function that reads `Config` and finds the entry absent will panic
///   with [`Error::NotInitialized`]; callers should ensure `initialize` has
///   been called before any other contract function.
///
/// ## Emitted events
/// Configuration mutations emit a `ConfigUpdated` event per changed field so
/// indexers can track admin actions without scanning storage. No event is
/// emitted during `initialize`.
///
/// ## Off-chain consumers
/// - Read the singleton via `get_config` (if exposed) or listen to
///   `ConfigUpdated` events to maintain a local mirror.
/// - Cache `require_username`, `min_username_length`, and
///   `max_username_length` client-side to validate usernames before

/// deployments), readers fall back to the compile-time defaults.
///
/// ## Policy semantics
/// Decay is modelled as **deterministic time buckets** (#1082). Time is divided
/// into consecutive buckets of `decay_interval_secs` seconds. Each time the
/// score is (re)computed at ledger time `now`, the whole number of buckets that
/// have elapsed since `last_decay_at` is `buckets = (now - last_decay_at) /
/// decay_interval_secs`. The score is then multiplied by
/// `(10_000 - decay_bps) / 10_000` exactly `buckets` times, using floor
/// (truncating) integer arithmetic so the result is identical for the same
/// inputs and can never exceed the pre-decay value.
///
/// ### Determinism & safety guarantees
/// - **Same history → same score.** The decayed score is a pure function of the
///   stored `trust_score`, `last_decay_at`, the policy, and the ledger time.
///   Repeated reads at the same ledger time always return the same value.
/// - **No underflow / no inflation.** Decay only ever multiplies by a factor
///   `<= 1`, saturating at `0`. It can never produce a negative score or create
///   trust that was not earned.
/// - **Bounded CPU.** At most [`MAX_DECAY_INTERVALS_PER_CALL`] buckets are
///   applied in a single evaluation; any remaining elapsed time is carried
///   forward and applied on the next lazy or scheduled evaluation, keeping every
///   call within the contract budget even after years of inactivity.
///
/// ### Lazy vs scheduled application
/// - **Lazy:** decay is applied automatically inside every read
///   ([`OnboardingContract::get_trust_score`],
///   [`OnboardingContract::get_reputation_state`]) and write
///   ([`OnboardingContract::update_reputation`],
///   [`OnboardingContract::update_reputation_for_settlement`]). Callers always
///   observe a current score without any background job.
/// - **Scheduled:** off-chain indexers / cron jobs can force an evaluation and
///   persist the result via
///   [`OnboardingContract::apply_reputation_decay_now`], keeping scores current
///   independently of user activity.
///
/// Successful increments are rejected while
/// `now < last_success_update_at + update_cooldown_secs`. Inside each
/// `farming_window_secs` window, at most `max_successful_per_window` successful
/// increments are credited. Disputed increments are never delayed or capped —

/// Normalize a raw username string into its canonical on-chain form.
///
/// # Integration notes — issue #497 / component #96
///
/// ## Purpose
/// All username storage keys and uniqueness checks operate on the
/// *normalized* form produced by this function. Clients and indexers
/// must apply the same normalization before constructing lookup keys or
/// comparing usernames.
///
/// ## Normalization rules (applied in order)
/// 1. ASCII alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`) are kept and
///    lowercased.
/// 2. Separator characters (space ` `, underscore `_`, hyphen `-`,
///    period `.`) are collapsed to a single `_`. Consecutive separators
///    produce exactly one `_`; leading and trailing separators are
///    stripped.
/// 3. A subset of Latin-extended and Cyrillic Unicode code points are
///    transliterated to their closest ASCII equivalents via
///    `map_username_bytes` (e.g. `ä` → `a`, `ß` → `ss`). Zero-width
///    joiners and BOM sequences are silently dropped.
/// 4. Any other byte sequence that is not matched by the above rules is
///    replaced with a single `_` separator (subject to the collapsing
///    rule in step 2).
/// 5. The result is always lowercase ASCII.
///
/// ## Input constraints
/// - Maximum input length: 256 bytes. Inputs exceeding this limit cause
///   a panic; callers should validate length before invoking.
/// - The function does **not** enforce minimum or maximum username
///   length — that is the responsibility of the calling function
///   (`onboard_user`, `change_username`) using the configured
///   `min_username_length` / `max_username_length` values.
///
/// ## Storage side-effects
/// - None. This is a pure transformation with no persistent reads or
///   writes.
///
/// ## Off-chain consumers
/// - Apply the same rules client-side before calling `is_username_taken`
///   or `get_user_by_username` to avoid false negatives caused by
///   un-normalized input.
/// - The `UserOnboarded` and `UsernameChanged` events carry the
///   already-normalized username; use those values verbatim for display
///   and reverse lookups.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `env` - Soroban environment reference
/// * `username` - Raw username string provided by the caller
///
/// # Returns
/// Normalized username as a `soroban_sdk::String` (lowercase ASCII,
/// separators collapsed, no leading/trailing `_`).

    ///
    /// ## Overview
    /// The onboarding contract provides a unified interface for managing user profiles,
    /// role assignments, and verification workflows on the CraftNexus platform.
    ///
    /// ## Core Structures
    ///
    /// ### UserProfile
    /// - **Purpose**: Represents a user's complete onboarding state
    /// - **Preconditions**: Must be initialized via `onboard_user` before access
    /// - **Storage**: Persistent key `DataKey::UserProfile(address)` with TTL auto-refresh
    /// - **Events Emitted**: `UserOnboardedEvent`, `RoleUpdated`, `PortfolioUpdated`
    ///
    /// ### OnboardingConfig
    /// - **Purpose**: System-wide settings for verification, username constraints
    /// - **Preconditions**: Must be initialized before any user operations
    /// - **Storage**: Singleton `DataKey::Config` with extended TTL for stability
    /// - **Modifiable By**: Platform admin only
    ///
    /// ### UserMetrics
    /// - **Purpose**: Tracks escrow volume and count for auto-verification eligibility
    /// - **Preconditions**: Populated only by escrow contract via `update_user_metrics`
    /// - **Storage**: `DataKey::UserMetrics(address)` updated asynchronously
    /// - **Side-Effects**: Auto-verification triggers when thresholds met
    ///
    /// ## API Parameters & Validation
    ///
    /// ### Username Constraints (Component #84)
    /// - **Format**: Normalized to lowercase, UTF-8 canonical form
    /// - **Length**: 3-50 characters after normalization
    /// - **Uniqueness**: Case-insensitive across all users (enforced via `DataKey::Username`)
    /// - **Reserved Names**: "admin" and derivations permanently reserved
    /// - **Change Cooldown**: 30 days between successive changes (prevents abuse)
    ///
    /// ### Role Transitions (Endpoint #85)
    /// - **Valid Roles**: Buyer, Artisan, Moderator (None and Admin excluded)
    /// - **Authorization**: Platform admin only; enforced via `require_auth()`
    /// - **Audit Trail**: All transitions logged to `VerifyHistoryIndexed`
    /// - **Event Emission**: `RoleUpdated` carries (user, old_role, new_role)
    ///
    /// ### Verification Workflow
    /// - **Auto-Verification**: Triggered when metrics meet thresholds (configurable)
    /// - **Manual Requests**: Queued in FIFO order via `VerificationQueueHead/Tail`
    /// - **History**: Last 10 entries retained per user (compact indexed format #519)
    /// - **State Machine**: none → requested → {approved|rejected} → verified
    ///
    /// ## Storage Optimization (Issue #82)
    /// - **Compact Types**: Uses `symbol_short` and flat `CompactVerificationEntry`
    /// - **TTL Strategy**: Entries extended only on active reads to conserve rent
    /// - **Lazy Migration**: Legacy Vec entries converted to indexed on first access
    /// - **Rent Calculation**: ~600 stroops/ledger for typical profile (28 bytes)
    ///
    /// ## Check-Effect-Interactions Pattern (Security)
    /// All state-mutating endpoints follow strict ordering:
    /// 1. **Check**: Validate authorization, preconditions, constraints
    /// 2. **Effect**: Update persistent storage, emit events
    /// 3. **Interact**: External token transfers (e.g., username change fees) LAST
    ///
    /// This prevents reentrancy where malicious callers trigger intermediate states
    /// via callbacks on arbitrary token contracts before final balance settlement.
